                    <p>It's no secret that the internet is capable of amazing things. But as a professional in an industry other than the internet, you've been forced to basically take up a secondary career in technology in order to even begin to leverage what the internet has to offer. </p>
                    <p>But you figure, "I should probably have something out there on the web." So, you settle for 'a website'. Once you decide to build a website your still left with the questions: What do you want? What do you need? What should your internet 'presence' include? </p>
                    <p>Well, as you're likely aware, the internet has become much, much more than web pages. There are hundreds and hundreds of fantastic tools available on the internet, with new ones popping up every day to solve some need or another. But the truth is, we only use a handful of them. Why? Because we only have certain types of problems that we need solved! We use the internet to work for us. NOT to get caught up in endless technology for the sake of technology - ultimately complicating and distracting us from our core work. </p>

                     <h4>Let me introduce myself</h4>
                     <p>My name is Terry Thomas C.F.C., President of Advisors Online.</p>
                     <p>Throughout the last 30 years, I have been a Professional Salesperson, Senior Estimator, General Manager, Business Owner, Certified Financial Consultant, Sales Trainer.</p>

                    <p class="border"><b>have always wondered if there is a better way of doing things; and have found that when someone tells me that something can’t be done, it usually can with some surprising results.<br>

                    Let me explain…</b></p>
                    <p>In 2000, I had a very successful financial practice member of the Million Dollar Club, Editor of the Institute of Financial Consultants news magazine, Presidents Advisory team. I did business with over 1200 families and businesses that where located throughout the province of British Columbia. This size of a client base requires a lot of attention and travel. An automobile accident created health issues that made this task even more difficult, since 50% of my business required travel.<b><i> I started searching for tools that would emulate personal meetings.</i></b></p>
                    <p>My search revealed that the tools available where one dimensional and inadequate for my purposes.</p>
                    <p  class="border"><b><i>I decided to develop my own solution that met my requirements.</i></b></p>
                    <p>The first item on my agenda was to identify the tools needed that would assist me in maintaining, developing and enhancing client relationships, emulate personal face to face meetings, conduct client reviews, share ideas and concepts, qualify and do needs analysis.</p>
                    <p>The result is an Online Office we call Agent Online that functions as a marketing, communication, live presentation and lead generation tool.,</p>
                    <p>I discovered I could qualify people in as little as 15 minutes, hire an assistant to do a lot of work that previously required my attention, do fact finding reviews and triple my effectiveness. I also discovered that I could qualify my prospect or client prior to anyone traveling. <b><i>Today I have a 100% closing ratio because I have qualified my prospect or client before anyone travels.</i></b></p>
